# ðŸŽ¹ MPK Mini to Roblox MIDI Bridge

This project bridges an **Akai MPK Mini** (or any MIDI controller) to **Roblox** using Python and Luau. It simulates key presses based on MIDI input so you can trigger in-game events like spotlights, effects, or anything else with real hardware.

> âœ… Built for Mac, works on Windows too.  
> ðŸŽ¯ No external apps needed (pure Python solution).  
> ðŸ”Œ Pads = key presses = Roblox input detection.
